      <description>Greetings!
I&amp;rsquo;m Tim Abraham, a Bay Area based data scientist, amateur cook, and lover of reading and learning new things. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working at Airbnb. Prior to that, I was the head of Analytics at expa, an early stage startup studio in San Francisco, and before that, I spent time at a company called StumbleUpon (remember that!?) and was a founding member of the Growth Data Science team at Twitter.</description>
