Greetings!


I'm Tim Abraham, a Bay Area based data scientist, amateur cook, and lover of reading and learning new things. I'm currently working at Airbnb. Prior to that, I was the head of Analytics at expa, an early stage startup studio in San Francisco, and before that, I spent time at a company called StumbleUpon (remember that!?) and was a founding member of the Growth Data Science team at Twitter. 

Currently, I do some advising and occasionally some freelance work. 

Here is where I try to do a little writing, a little data blogging, summarise what I've been reading, and write down my favorite recipes for posterity.

I also just published a book, [**Metabase Up and Running**](https://www.amazon.com/Metabase-Running-Introduce-intelligence-analytics/dp/1800202318). If you are interested in analytics, or found me [via my YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/TimAbraham), I highly recommend you check out the book!

I was born in Oakland, CA and currently live right across the border in Berkeley.
