This pumpkin pie recipe is inspired by Chef John from Food Wishes. He also adds Chinese 5 Spice, which I don't think goes well here.

This pie is delicious because it's a bit more custardy than a normal pumpkin pie, by virtue of having a few more egg yolks in it.

# Ingredients 

* 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 large egg
* 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice (or a combo of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg)
* Â½ teaspoon fine salt
* 1 [blind baked pie crust](../pie-crust)

Whisk pumpkin and eggs together, and then add condensed milk. Whisk together more. Add spices and salt, and pour into your blind baked crust.

Bake at 425 for 15 minutes, and then at 350 for about 30 more minutes.

Be very careful as you slide it into the oven, since you don't want it to splash against the sides of the crust. I also recommend covering the exposed parts of the crust with foil to prevent them from burning.

Let the pie cool before putting it into the oven, that should prevent cracking.
