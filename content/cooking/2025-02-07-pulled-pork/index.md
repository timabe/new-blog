## Ingredients

- **Pork Shoulder (Boston Butt):** Any size, but the recipe is for 8 pounds, so scale back the rub according to size

### Brine Solution

- 8 cups water
- 1/2 cup salt
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 bay leaves

### Dry Rub

- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

### 1. Brining the Pork

1. **Prepare the Brine:** In a large container, combine water, salt, brown sugar, dry rub mix, and bay leaves. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved. I sometimes accomplish this by boiling water so it dissolves the salt and sugar, and then I add ice.
2. **Submerge the Pork:** Place the pork shoulder in the brine solution, ensuring it's fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, preferably overnight.

### 2. Applying the Dry Rub

1. **Mix the Rub:** In a bowl, combine all dry rub ingredients.
2. **Season the Pork:** Remove the pork from the brine and pat it dry. Generously apply the dry rub all over the pork, pressing it into the meat.

### 3. Cooking 

1. **Preheat Oven:** Set your oven to 225째F (107째C).
2. **Prepare for Baking:** Place the seasoned pork shoulder on a rack in a deep pan.
3. **Roast:** Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the pork. Roast in the oven until the internal temperature reaches 200째F (93째C). This process can take between 12 to 15 hours, depending on the size of the pork shoulder.

### 4. Resting and Shredding 

1. **Shred the Pork:** Rest the pork until it's cool enough to shred. Then, using two forks, pull the pork apart into shreds.
2. **Serve:** Enjoy the pulled pork on its own, or serve with your favorite barbecue sauce and sides.
