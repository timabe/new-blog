<p>The secret to this blueberry pie is using fresh blueberries and leaving <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> of them completely uncooked. Adding the raw blueberries to the sweetened, cooked ones gives the pie a wonderful fresh taste and a nice tart flavor to complement the sweetness. This is probably my favorite pie, and my go-to during the summer.</p>
<p>This recipe was passed down to me by a true southern gentleman named Frank.</p>

<h3>Cook your filling</h3>
<p>Add 2 cups of blueberries, water, sugar, salt and cornstarch to a small pot or saucepan. On low heat, stir all the ingredients together. Continue stirring until blueberries break down and release their juices, around 10-15 minutes. Mixture should thicken and look like pie filling. Add butter and lemon juice.</p>

<h3>Add fresh blueberries</h3>
<p>Toss in the remaining 2 cups of fresh blueberries into the cooked mixture, and stir to combine. Pour entire mixture into a pre (blind) baked crust. Oh, and the crust is important, <a href="https://www.timabe.info/cooking/pie-crust">so please make from scratch using my recipe.</a></p>
